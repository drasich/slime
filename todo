make the player component a module/library
or make the game a library?
if each component is a library we can remove the component and add it
again while the game is loading...

make a component manager and add component to the manager;
pas la peine de sauver les widgets en fait... mais il faut release
correctement


fix the gl callbacks init, update, draw.... for gameview;
open the gameview and update the components there

be able to add/remove properties (make some kind of component = group properties)
be able to script an object and then go play/pause

each object can be attributed a library or script
the library is inherited from an interface.


//pour plus tard
handle properties when multiple objects selected
=> make a structure in context with position and rotation
be able to create an empty and change mesh in the properties
