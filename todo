make the player component a module/library
or make the game a library?
make a component manager and add component to the manager;
be able to add/remove component


fix the gl callbacks init, update, draw.... for gameview;
open the gameview and update the components there

be able to add/remove properties (make some kind of component = group properties)
be able to script an object and then go play/pause

each object can be attributed a library or script
the library is inherited from an interface.


//pour plus tard
handle properties when multiple objects selected
=> make a structure in context with position and rotation
be able to create an empty and change mesh in the properties
