ajouter une camera object:
- camera component
- scene properties to set the camera

remve component properties callback (now it is in the component)

make vec3, vec4 a possible type to edit easily
comment faire pour editer facilement un enum...


decider si transform devient un component a part en dehors d'object
et aussi "object properties" "name, ..."

release les components widgets correctement


fix the gl callbacks init, update, draw.... for gameview;
open the gameview and update the components there

be able to add/remove properties (make some kind of component = group properties)
be able to script an object and then go play/pause

//pour plus tard
handle properties when multiple objects selected
=> make a structure in context with position and rotation
be able to create an empty and change mesh in the properties

now there is only one library but:
if each component is a library we can remove the component and add it
again while the game is loading...
