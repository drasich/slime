LATELY
- rotate dragger : display a better disk
- make the rotation again in the spinner
- also fix the scale (start from last scale)
- need global/local button
- update the tree with children etc
- display info on rotation, scale, translation
- translation with local plane 

CLEAN
- TODO in the code.
- fix functions name -> put the verb at the end
- clean the scene when?

ISSUES (must be done)
- use id instead of comparing string strcmp(component->name,"mesh") ?
- save the component functions in the component manager
- change properties in ComponentDesc so there is only one to be created and I
  can remove the one in create_component and object_post_read
- in control.c, _op_change_property save the data if it's not a pointer to existing data (like an int)
- Fix property component update - remove object from parameter?
- open play window and close the main window with the cross -> crash : because 
  control is clean in view_destroy and then there is a pointer to control in gameview that is
  used in the cleaning for gameview, I removed the free(v->control) temporarily but there shouldn't
  be control in gameview... component manager I have to check

BUG
- focus the play and main windows alternatively(with the mouse)
  and close with escape sometimes window manager freeze. (maybe when
  there is composite in the window manager)


RENDER
- decide how to draw with camera ortho and per
  - choose ortho or pers in mesh component?, but what if I want I special
    width and height
  - make a default camera, but make it possible to choose another camera, in
    mesh component.
  - objects inherit the camera from the parent or the root.
  - there is a tree of objects, and also groups of objects, one group for
    every camera
  - make something like draw(Component* c, Render_info* info) where info has the matrix
    the uniform to sets etc...?
- mesh component
   - be able to choose between drawelements or drawarrays, etc ?
- material

VIEW
- make draggers translate, rotation, scale
- save view : save camera position and scene... window size?
- make the camera display better
- remove the animator for view?

ARCHITECTURE
- texture manager
- make the mesh/resource manager. just input the name and it loads in
  the background
- child and parent
- make material to handle textures, uniform etc
- init mode et real mode
- decider si transform devient un component a part en dehors d'object
et aussi "object properties" "name, ..."
- make one component, one library? instead of one big library for all?
- add lua-jit


PROPERTIES
- make a hash of property_set, create_component(component manager, desc)
  get propertyset or create if doesn't exit yet
- camera choose ortho or pers, make an enum property

- make vec4 a possible type to edit easily
- material
- comment faire pour editer facilement un enum...
- pointeur sur un object ou autre type
  - use pointer in the applicatio but...
  - ...make an id system for saving object
  - display the name of the object
  - comment set l'object sur la propriete?
    - il faut pouvoir drag a partir du tree, ou bien peut etre de la view.
    - selectionner dans une liste?
    - ecrire le nom de l'object (le plus simple)
- make a hide property for component, to avoid display in properties
- scene properties: set the camera (among other things)
- remove component properties callback?
  but maybe needed when we edit multiple objects
- handle properties when multiple objects selected?
  => make a structure in context with position and rotation
  be able to create an empty and change mesh in the properties
- spinner : handle undo/redo->add signals


CODE
- release les components widgets correctement
- check everything for cleaning
  - component widget
  - ...


GAMEVIEW
- check the gl callbacks init, update, draw.... for gameview;

IDEAS
- in the component managers, for all the components add objects
  to component, then call init update on the component that calls it for
  all objects that has this component... (but we cannot choose the order 
  of the components)
